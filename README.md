Razorpay-Clone
This open-source project aims to replicate the user interface and user experience of the RazorPay website's frontend. RazorPay is a popular payment gateway that provides a smooth payment processing experience for businesses and their customers.

HTML and TailwindCSS are the technologies used in this project.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables users to create applications faster and easier. It provides a wide range of responsive utility classes that can be used to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS
